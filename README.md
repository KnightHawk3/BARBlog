## Deploy

I don't use this but if I am dead, and your reading this, start here.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default)


The correct way (the "mel is still alive and can help and I dont want to spend money" way) is to download this repository, install the dependencies (`npm install` from the directory) then run `gatsby build --prefix-paths` and rename `public` to `docs` then push it to a github repository, turn on github pages then point your domain name at the github pages for free hosting.
